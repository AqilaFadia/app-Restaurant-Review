This dataset was created for the Paper 'From Group to Individual Labels using Deep Features', Kotzias et. al,. KDD 2015 contains sentences labeled with a positive or negative sentiment. The score is either 1 (for positive) or 0 (for negative) The sentences come from three different websites/fields:
imdb.com, amazon.com, yelp.com. For each website, there exist 500 positive and 500 negative sentences. Those were selected randomly for larger datasets of reviews.
We attempted to select sentences that have a clearly positive or negative connotation, the goal was for no neutral sentences to be selected.
